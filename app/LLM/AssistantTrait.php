            Message::user('Hmm, I’m leaning toward something casual and accessible, maybe a puzzle or arcade-style game. Something that could work well on mobile or PC.'),
            Message::assistant('Great starting point! How about this: a game where the player rearranges pieces of a chaotic picture or map to restore order? Each level could represent a different theme—like fixing a torn-up treasure map, repairing constellations in the night sky, or putting together a robot’s broken circuits.'),
            Message::user('Interesting! I like the idea of fixing things, but I wonder if it could have more dynamic gameplay. Maybe some time pressure or unique mechanics?'),
            Message::assistant('Got it! What if it’s a race against time, but you’re restoring a machine that affects the environment in real-time? For example, you’re fixing a water pump while watching a village slowly flood. As you repair the parts, the water recedes, and you have to strategically decide what to fix first.'),
            Message::user('That sounds exciting! I like the idea of visible consequences as you play. Could it also involve some resource management, like choosing between fixing or saving parts?'),
            Message::assistant('Absolutely. For instance, you could collect or scavenge parts as you go, and those parts could double as tools for solving puzzles. Maybe there’s a trade-off: using a part for a repair now might leave you short later in the level.'),
            Message::user('Oh, that’s a good twist. It adds some strategy. How about adding a story element? Maybe you’re a character trying to fix something personal, like a cherished family heirloom or a spaceship to get back home.'),
            Message::assistant('I love that! A narrative element could deepen engagement. Imagine you’re stranded on a hostile planet, repairing your ship while encountering alien ecosystems that react to your progress. Each repair brings you closer to escape but also triggers new challenges, like hostile wildlife or environmental hazards.'),
            Message::user('That’s a cool idea! It could even be a mix of puzzle-solving and exploration. You’re gathering the parts and solving mini-puzzles to repair things. Maybe some parts are hidden in areas that need creative problem-solving to access.'),
            Message::assistant('Perfect blend of mechanics! Let’s call it something thematic, like Patchwork Odyssey or Salvage Escape. What do you think?'),
            Message::user('Salvage Escape sounds awesome! I think we’ve got a solid concept here. Thanks for the help!'),
            Message::assistant('Anytime! Let me know when you’re ready to dive into more details, like art style, level design, or mechanics refinement. This is going to be a fun project!'),
